## Introduction 

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained form the FBI. 

We are going to use the following library:

```{r loading-libs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

and load the data we already wrangled:

```{r}
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

## Murder rate by state

We note the large stata to state variablity by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state:

```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
    geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") +
    coord_flip() 

```
