Introduction
------------

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained form the FBI.

We are going to use the following library:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

and load the data we already wrangled:

``` r
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

Murder rate by state
--------------------

We note the large stata to state variablity by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state:
